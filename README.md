# Medical-Image-Analysis-using-Deep-Learning

In this project, We have deployed a model that detects whether a person is having Pneumonia or not. 
The image classification is done by using Convolution Neural Network (CNN). 
CNN is an artificial neural network that has the ability to detect patterns in the images.
Medical image analysis is a deep learning project in which medical images are analysed using CNN. 
CNN helps us to classify the images on the basis of certain patterns. 
In this model I have chosen a dataset having Chest X-Ray images.
